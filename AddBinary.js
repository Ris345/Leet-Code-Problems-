// Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.
// Input: a = "11", b = "1"
// Output: "100"
// Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
// Output: "10101"

var addBinary = function (a, b) { 
  let carry = 0; 
  let result = 0; 
  // binary numbers are only 1 & 0 anything greater than that gets conversted into 0 || 1  
    // test case 1 + 11 = 100 --> step [1] 1 + 1  = 2 carry over 1 and add 0 there instead and add 0 for next 1 + 1  = 0 then put the final remainning 1 at the end
     //
    
    // if sum > 3 invalid
      // sum > 2 || sum > 1 show 0 but return 1
       //

 // so 1 + 1 = 2 ---> carry over 1 but should be 0 and then move that one to another number which makes it 0 and again an fonally number 1 gets added
